# Introduction

This is the a quick starter project I made and use to quickly experiment stuffs in Vanilla js. You can also start a project from scratch.

# Installation

```
npm install
npm start
```

And then go to `localhost:1234`

# Structure

All the code you're editing is in the src folder.

All the images, svg, fonts go in the assets folder.
